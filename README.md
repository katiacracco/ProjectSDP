Dronazon - Author: Katia Cracco

Project developed for the Distributed and Pervasive Systems Course in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano

The aim of the project was to create a system that would manage the delivery of orders received from the e-commerce site Dronazon, through a flock of drones distributed within a smart-city. Each time a customer of Dronazon places a new order, this information is passed to the master drone of the smart-city, which then determines which drone should make that delivery.
Furthermore, each delivery implies battery consumption, so a drone whose battery is less than 15% must be recharged.
The drones also communicate to a remote server a series of information on the number of deliveries made, the number of kilometres travelled, the level of air pollution detected and the remaining battery level.
